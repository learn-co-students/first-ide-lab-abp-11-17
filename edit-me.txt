First lab.
Trying to see how this works
So in the command line
  learn
    -to start a test but needs ctrl+S to save first and make sure blue dot disappears from tab
  learn save
    -to save and push what you have done to github even though it isn't working or complete
  learn submit
    -to submit the lab
