Hello World (oh, no, not again);
Hello People of the World (oh, well, not good, but sounds less repetitive)

good!

Patterns
  project name = upper folder name in the tree
  subfolders and sibling files
  Saving files
  creating new files
    note: the context menu helps to locate it
    ????: path for the new file? is it my local file tree?
          It's ok, just enter a name and press enter. by default
            the ide will assume the current project path.
